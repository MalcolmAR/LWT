<p>The first set of notes at the top of the goals.py and lwt.py files list work I would like to do. I'm open to suggestions for next steps or additional features, but please spend some time using the scripts first so I know you suggestions come from experience with the tracking system.</p>
<p>Thank you to all who get in touch, and peace be with you!</p>
